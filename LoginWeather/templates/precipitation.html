                <h2>What is Precipitation?</h2>
                <p>Precipitation refers to any form of water - liquid or solid - that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the ground. It includes various forms such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Precipitation is a critical component of the water cycle and is vital for life on Earth, influencing weather patterns, climate, and the environment.</p>
                <h3>Common Forms of Precipitation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rain:</strong> Liquid water droplets that fall when atmospheric temperatures are above freezing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Snow:</strong> Ice crystals that fall when atmospheric temperatures are below freezing, accumulating as solid flakes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleet:</strong> Frozen raindrops or refrozen melted snowflakes that fall as ice pellets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hail:</strong> Hard, rounded pellets or lumps of ice that are larger and more damaging than sleet.</li>
                </ul>
