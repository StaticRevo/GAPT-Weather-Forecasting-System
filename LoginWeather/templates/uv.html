                <h2>What is the UV Index?</h2>
                <p>The UV Index is a standard measurement of the strength of sunburn-producing ultraviolet radiation at a particular place and time. Values of the index range from zero upward - the higher the UVI value, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes, and the less time it takes for harm to occur.</p>
                <h3>UV Index Scale:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0-2 Low:</strong> A low risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure.</li>
                    <li><strong>3-5 Moderate:</strong> A moderate risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure.</li>
                    <li><strong>6-7 High:</strong> A high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Protection against skin and eye damage is needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>8-10 Very High:</strong> Very high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Take extra precautions because unprotected skin and eyes will be damaged and can burn quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>11+ Extreme:</strong> Extreme risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Take all precautions because unprotected skin and eyes can burn in minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's recommended to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen if you need to be outside during daylight hours when UV levels are high.</p>
