                <h2>Understanding Atmospheric Pressure</h2>
                <p>Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the air above it. This pressure is measured using a barometer and is expressed in units called hectopascals (hPa), also known as millibars. Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 1013.25 hPa.</p>
                <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weather Prediction:</strong> Changes in atmospheric pressure can indicate upcoming weather conditions. For example, falling pressure suggests worsening weather conditions, while rising pressure indicates improving weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Altitude Effects:</strong> Pressure decreases with higher altitudes which can affect breathing, boiling point of water, and aircraft operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health and Well-being:</strong> Sudden changes in atmospheric pressure can influence human and animal behavior and health, such as joint pain or headaches in some people.</li>
